    Warning: if you use a Microsoft email such as Outlook or Hotmail, you won't
    be able to receive email from Lutris. This will make it impossible to confirm
    your email address and to post on the forums. This may affect a few other email
    providers as well. If you haven't received a confirmation email, you can change
    it in your profile to a supported provider and confirm your address.
